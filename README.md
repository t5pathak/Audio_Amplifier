# Audio Amplifier

An audio power amplifier (or power amp) is an electronic amplifier that amplifies low-power electronic audio signals to a level that is high enough for driving loudspeakers or headphones. It is the final electronic stage in a typical audio playback chain before the signal is sent to the loudspeakers.

The aim of the project is to construct an Audio Amplifier capable of amplifying sound signals by a factor of 500 while minimising noise picked up by the microphone.

# Building Blocks of the Amplifier

1. Microphone
2. Pre-Amplifier
3. Gain Stage
4. Filter
5. Power Amplifier
6. Load Stage
